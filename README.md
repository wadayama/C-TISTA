# C-TISTA
C-TISTA for linear/non-linear inverse problems 

This code is an implementation of Complex-field Trainable ISTA (C-TISTA) for linear/non-linear inverse problems in PyTorch. The details of the algorithm can be found in the paper: Satoshi Takabe, Tadashi Wadayama, "Complex Field-Trainable ISTA for Linear and Nonlinear Inverse Problems", arXiv:1904.07409. The code includes some basic operations for complex-valued tensors.
